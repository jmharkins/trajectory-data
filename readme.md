# Trajectory Project Repo
Messing around with analysis of Geolife Dataset (see below) in Python and Pandas

### Files:
- `traj-parse.py`: Python script for merging transit mode information with locations. Assumes folder in working directory with unpacked Geolife data as compressed in source link below
- `010_trip_labeled.csv`: Result of traj-parse.py on a single user's trajectories

Geolife dataset can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367).
